# BaseJSGulp
**QuickBase automatic build system**

## What is gulp?

gulp is a toolkit that will help you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow. For web development (if that's your thing) it can help you by doing CSS preprocessing, JS transpiling, minification, live reloading, and much more.

## What is BaseGulp?

BaseGulp utilizes gulp and its plugins to automate and enhance the development workflow for QuickBase. These automated tasks include uploading consolidated pages to your app, pushing to a git repo, compiling SCSS, JSX, ES6, etc. 

## Setup
- Clone repo, https://github.com/AdvantageIntegratedSolutions/BaseJSGulp.git
- Fill out app.json with QuickBase settings.
- Run either "gulp deploy" or "gulp watch" to begin automating tasks!!
